The app can be extended in several ways:
1) Add more fruits eg. oranges, bananas, watermelon etc.
2) Add vegetables as well
3) Send image of wrongly classified image (when the user gives a feedback for the predcition) to the
the app developer (me in this case!) and improve the model using those images (augment the dataset)
4) In an image of multiple fruits/vegetables display the count of each category.
5) Given that some fruits occur in only specific region, give the users in that region added categories
of special fruits in their region.
6) Predict on a scale how badly rotten a fruit is.

Adding more fruits and vegetables will cater to people interested in other fruits and increase the number of users.
