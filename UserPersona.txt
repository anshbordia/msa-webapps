-------------The Apple Quality Checker App---------------

The apple qulity checker app tells the user whether the apple(s) in the image
are fresh or rotten.

This app caters to any user who is in the need for figuring out if the apple is
fresh or rotten.
Some use cases can be:
1) A supermarket customer selecting apples
2) A fruit seller discarding rotten apples.

As a result, the user can be of any gender, age, occupation etc. Essentailly they should
have a need to find out if their apple is fresh or rotten

Wihtout the app, the user in need can struggle in the two following ways:
1) Can't differentiate between fresh and rotten apples
2) Takes too long to decide quality of each apple manually

Hence, this app eases the users pain in the following ways:
1) To help someone who can't differentiate between fresh and rotten apples.
2) To help someone speed up the detection process as this app can work with
and return quality results of several apples in an image instantly. 
Both these processes are done using an AI object detector trained to identify
fresh and rotten apples.
